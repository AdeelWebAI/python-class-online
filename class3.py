# string methods
# First of all keep in mind that strings are 'immutable'. Means directly you can't change the strings. Every string method that you will apply that will make a new string using that method.

a = "It is a string"
# print(len(a)) # length of a string
# print(a.upper()) # upper case
# print(a.lower()) # lower case
# print(a.rstrip("@!")) # strip the trailing characters from end
# print(a.replace("Python","zero")) # replace characters or words
# print(a.split(" ")) # it converts the string into a list
# print(a.capitalize()) # this makes first character of string capitalize
# print(a.center(20)) # it addes the number of spaces before the string
# print(a.count("It")) # count the words or character in string
